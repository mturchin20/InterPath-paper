\begin{abstract}\label{InterPath-Abstract}

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified thousands of significant genetic associations in humans across a number of complex traits. However, the vast majority of these studies use datasets of predominantly European ancestry. This discrepancy is a persistent, known issue, however the body of work showing the benefits of diverse genomic datasets to additive complex trait genetics only continues to grow, including more ancestry-specific estimates of effect sizes and increased discoveries of associated, putative causal variants.\footnote{\red{SR: I'm not sure this sentence is doing much for you. It's also a bit awkwardly phrased and hard to parse - should be shorter and more direct.}} Here, we explore a form of non-additive trait architecture, epistasis, to see if there are similar insights that can be gained in complex traits when analyzing a particularly diverse dataset. To increase our power to detect epistasis, we create a new method to detect pathway-level marginal epistasis (MAPIT-R), and apply this method to a diverse group of ancestry subsets within the UK BioBank (UKB) dataset. We analyze height and BMI with the KEGG and REACTOME databases and find 245 pathways with statistically significant signals of marginal epistasis. We find that the majority \red{why not give the percentage?} of these results are found in an African subset of the UKB data (165 of 245). We find that BMI consistently produces stronger signals of pathway-level marginal epistasis than height. And we find that pathway-level genetic diversity is unlikely to be a major factor in driving these signals of marginal epistasis.\footnote{\red{SR: what do you mean here?}}

\section{Introduction}\label{InterPath-Introduction}

 Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are a powerful tool for identifying statistical associations between genetic variation and complex traits, and have identified over 24,000 statistically significant such associations in humans alone \citep{Buniello2019}. However, it is also \red{well-known} that GWA studies and related research directions have been incredibly focused on populations of European ancestry\red{, with non-European ancestry samples constituting at most 20\% of analyzed samples in the GWAS Catalog?} \citep{Need2009, Popejoy2016,Gurdasani2019,Martin2019,Sirugo2019}.

This lack of diverse representation \red{persists despite} the numerous ways incorporating non-European\footnote{\red{SR: might be better to just say ``diverse''}} ancestries benefits genomic analyses: for example, imputation performance \citep{Huang2009,Howie2011,Das2018,Kowalski2019}, and polygenic risk score analyses \citep{Martin2017a,Duncan2019,Kerminen2019,Rosenberg2019,Marnetto2020,Mostafavi2020}. In GWA and eQTL studies, investigating more diverse sets of human ancestries can lead\footnote{\red{SR: why not ``leads to" instead of ``can lead to"}} to more accurate effect size estimates and greater numbers of novel associations \citep{Dumitrescu2011,Stranger2012,Carlson2013,Bien2019,Mogil2018,Gurdasani2019,Kuchenbaecker2019,Wojcik2019,Zhong2019}. And further for association study frameworks in general, properly accounting for population structure can limit false positives and increase power to detect associations \citep{Kang2010,Price2010,Zhou2012,Sul2018}.\footnote{\red{SR: not sure how this sentence helps with your argument....structure is usually controlled for, right?}} This last phenomenon is of particular importance as biobank-size datasets only continue to expand; finescale latent population structure is still an ongoing confounder in human genomic analyses \citep{Berg2019,Sohail2019,Lawson2020}, and growing databases may lead to increased exposure of such latent structures \citep{Haworth2019,Dai2020,Sakaue2020,Lawson2020}. 

The question then is why this dataset ancestry representation problem still persists. Structural issues, such as biases in funding allocations and resource availability, are certainly a major contributor. Another contributor may be a continued under appreciation of what investigating non-European populations can provide to genomic analyses. Here, we aim to show once again the profound, if not essential, benefit non-European populations provide in terms of novel insight into human complex trait genetic architecture.\footnote{\red{SR: I would cut this whole paragraph; I appreciate the points but they have been made elsewhere.}}

To accomplish this, we followed past examples of how incorporating diverse collections of human ancestries into GWA, eQTL, and PRS frameworks lead to novel insights into complex trait genetic architecture, and we investigated the potential benefits of incorporating a diverse dataset into frameworks for studying genetic epistasis.\footnote{\red{SR: I would make this sentence start more with ``Our objective here'' and describe that the goal is to detect epistasis at biologically intepretable scales and then to incorporate diverse datasets into such analyses. I think the first sentence you wrote is more of a discussion point. I don't think we should motivate this in this way but rather point out in the Discussion that other studies have taken this approach.}} Epistasis is a well-established phenomenon in a number of model organisms \citep{Lehner2006,Rowe2008,Shao2008,Flint2009,Costanzo2010,He2010,Jarvis2011,Pettersson2011,Bloom2013,Monnahan2015}, and has been suggested as a major \red{driver?} of both complex trait genetic architecture and evolution \citep{Carlborg2004,Carlborg2006,Martin2007,Phillips2008,Moore2009,Jones2014,Mackay2014}. However, there remains skepticism regarding the extent to which epistasis has \red{affected} human populations \citep{Hill2008,Crow2010,Aschard2012,Wood2014,Yang2015}. Recent methodological advances have shown increasing evidence for epistasis in humans \citep{Verma2016,Crawford2017a,Fang2019,Runcie2019}, but most of these efforts have been conducted in European ancestry populations. It is unclear what novel insight a diverse set of non-European populations might provide in epistasis, especially in light of the aforementioned results that additive architecture\footnote{\red{SR: this is the first time you have referred to additive architecture - you should define/refer to GWA effects also}} varies across human populations as well \citep{Dumitrescu2011,Carlson2013,Kuchenbaecker2019,Wojcik2019}.

In this study, we present \red{MAPIT-R}, a new methodological framework for analyzing marginal epistasis on the \red{region and/or?} pathway level. We analyze epistasis in height and body mass index (BMI) at multiple genomic \red{scales} across six different human ancestry subsets present in the UK BioBank (UKB) \citep{Sudlow2015} dataset, and find that an African ancestry UKB subset produces many more significant epistatic pathways than any other UKB ancestry subset (165 of 245 total significant pathways \red{how many subgroups analyed?}). \red{You need to define what a significant hit is - a pathway with a large marginal epistatic signal? Marginal epistasis has not been identified, and there's no mention of why one might want to look at pathways? I would think you would want to highlight some GWA enrichment analyses like RSS and gene-e} We find pathways related to cellular signaling and the immune system are often represented among our significant hits, and evidence that the proteasome may be particularly enriched for epistatic interactions.\footnote{\red{SR: I think this sentence, related to my last comment, should start with something like "Our significant hits for epistastic interactions include pathways realted to cellualar signaling...." is this in both traits?}} We find that BMI on average produces stronger signals of pathway-level marginal epistasis than height, in line with previous results suggesting BMI may be more influenced by non-additive factors than height \citep{Elks2012,Visscher2012}. And lastly we find that differences between ancestries are unlikely to be due to large, broadscale patterns of genetic variation.\footnote{\red{SR: as I noted, unsure what this sentence means.}}    


\section{Results}\label{InterPath-Results}

\subsection{Single-SNP Methods Provide Limited Evidence For Epistasis}\label{InterPath-Results-SNPEpistasis}

To begin investigating epistasis in non-European ancestries, we first extracted multiple non-European population subsets from the UK BioBank (UKB) dataset, including individuals of African, Caribbean, Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani self-identified ancestry (Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-UKB-Subsets-PCAPlot} and Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). For comparative purposes, we also extracted a British subset; but to make it on a matched scale as the non-European subset sample sizes, we used a random subsample of 4,000 British individuals. Across all these population subsets, we conducted typical quality control (QC) procedures (see Materials and Methods) and focused our analyses on the complex traits of height and body mass index (BMI). 

To analyze epistasis on the single variant level, we take two different approaches. First, we ran the canonical model of pairwise SNP interactions implemented by PLINK (see Materials and Methods). This approach exhaustively searches through every pairwise set of SNPs and tests whether there is a significantly non-zero interaction effect size. Running this method on each of our population subsets we find that no pairs of SNPs produce a genome-wide significant interaction (Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-PLINK-HeightBMI-AllPops}). Here we define `genome-wide significant' as having an interaction $p$-value $<= 5\times10^{-13}$, which is the approximate Bonferroni-corrected $p$-value threshold given the over $1\times10^{11}$ number of tests that were conducted. This lack of significant results may not be surprising given such a heavy multiple-testing burden. Alternatively, we can forgo such a stringent criteria and instead look at SNPs that are marginally significant ($p$-value $<= 1\times10^{-4}$); since this produces many possible interactions per SNP, we can also instead look at the \textbf{proportion} of marginally significant interactions per SNP as a more appropriate metric.  

Looking at this new framework, we start to see different patterns between our ancestry subsets (Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-PLINK-Proportions-HeightBMI}). We find that different areas of the genome are producing SNPs with large proportions of marginally significant interactions across our different subsets (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-PLINK-Proportions-TopSNPs-a}), as well as different baseline levels of marginally significant interactions between ancestry subsets as well (such as the Chinese and Pakistani subsets having the largest baseline interactions in height). However, we once again do not have many individual SNPs that particularly stand out. 

The second approach we took to investigate single-SNP epistasis was to implement MAPIT \citep{Crawford2017a}, a method which specifically tests for the presence of \textit{marginal epistasis} (see Materials and Methods). In brief, the marginal epistasis of a single SNP can be thought of as the summation of \textbf{all} epistatic interactions that SNP has with the rest of the genome. Evidence for marginal epistasis does not immediately identify \textbf{which} loci elsewhere in the genome the SNP of interest is interacting with, but in exchange for this generalization the approach turns a highly burdensome multiple-testing setup into a much more tractable variance component model.

Running MAPIT on our population subsets for both height and BMI, we find that there are no SNPs with genome-wide significant signals for marginal epistasis ($p$-value $<= 5\times10^{-8}$; Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-MAPIT-HeightBMI}). We do see once again the top SNPs occurring in different regions of the genome between our different population subsets (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPIT-TopSNPs-a}). But it is unclear if these are results reflecting true biology or simply noise due to a lack of power. To see if there were common patterns between analyzing marginal epistasis and direct pairwise epistasis, we compared our MAPIT results against our PLINK results. Specifically, we compared each SNP's MAPIT -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value against its proportion of marginal significant PLINK interactions, and we see more potential evidence for patterns of epistasis (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-PLINKvsMAPIT-HeightBMI-African} \& Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-MAPITvsPLINK-HeightBMI-AllPops-a}). Looking at height and BMI in the African subset for example, we see that for some SNPs that have marginally significant MAPIT $p$-values, they also have greater proportions of marginally significant pairwise SNP interactions. Because these two metrics are potentially measuring the same signal but through different approaches, seeing marginal signals from both methods at the same locus is encouraging. Therefore, despite our limited power to identify single-SNP genome-wide significant interactions, there may be evidence for epistasis at lower stringency thresholds in our data.

\caption[TBD]{\textbf{Comparison of single-SNP epistasis methods in African subset}. The figure shows the single-SNP PLINK results vs. MAPIT results for height and BMI in the African subset. The PLINK results are shown on the $x$-axis as the proportion of marginally significant interactions per SNP (where marginally significant is defined as $p$-value $<= 1\times10^{-4}$) and the MAPIT results are shown on the $y$-axis as the -$\log_{10}$ of the MAPIT $p$-values. The dotted red line shows the line of best fit, and the correlation between the two metrics is shown in the legend. We observe a subset of SNPs with greater marginal epistasis (higher -$\log_{10}$ $p$-values) beginning to correlate with having larger proportions of marginally significant SNP-by-SNP interactions. Seeing the same signal between two different approaches suggests there may be evidence for epistasis on the single-SNP level, albeit weak. For the same plots across all UKB subsets, see Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-MAPITvsPLINK-HeightBMI-AllPops}.}
\label{InterPath-Main-Figure-PLINKvsMAPIT-HeightBMI-African}
\end{figure}

There remains the issue though of our limited sample sizes and datasets. As previously discussed, there are ongoing efforts to increase the number of non-European individuals publicly available for complex trait analysis \citep{Matise2011,Kowalski2019}, but these numbers still currently pale in comparison to what is available for European individuals. Therefore, we need to identify alternative ways to improve power to detect signals of epistasis with our current datasets. The approaches we have used thus far have revolved around testing single variants. However, it is well-appreciated in other association approaches, such as GWA studies, that aggregating evidence for association across multiple variants can increase power to detect significant associations \citep{Cantor2010,Wang2010,Oldmeadow2011,Ramanan2012,Chimusa2019,White2019}. Therefore, we decided to explore whether taking a similar aggregate approach towards epistatic analyses would lead to an increase in significant associations as well. 

\subsection{Many Pathways Identified As Genome-Wide Significant for Marginal Epistatic Interactions in the African Subset}\label{InterPath-Results-PathwayEpistasis}

Therefore to create a new method that uses multiple SNPs to analyze epistasis, we expanded the previous MAPIT framework into a new model that goes from identifying single-SNP marginal epistasis to identifying multiple-SNP marginal epistasis; we call this approach MAPIT-R, for \underline{MA}rginal e\underline{PI}stasis \underline{T}est for \underline{R}egions. For a full description of this new model please see Materials and Methods, but in brief the main change we make is to go from a single SNP of interest \textbf{k} to a collection of SNPs of interest \textbf{R}. This in turns leads us to incorporate a new random effect  \textbf{Q} that represents the epistatic interactions between all the SNPs in \textbf{R} with all the remaining variants (SNPs not in \textbf{R}) across the genome. Using the same MQS \citep{Zhou2017} setup as MAPIT did, we then test whether the variance component associated with \textbf{Q}, $\phi$ is significantly different from zero. If $\phi$ is significantly different from zero, it indicates that there is detectable marginal epistatic interactions between our group of SNPs \textbf{R} and the rest of the genome.

Since this is a generalizable approach that allows for any set of SNPs \textbf{R} to be tested, we decided to begin by using known biological pathways. Specifically, we utilized the KEGG and REACTOME pathway datasets from the MSigDB \citep{Liberzon2011}; we chose these pathways due to their coverage of a wide range of biological processes as well as their wide range of pathway gene sizes. This would not only potentially allow us to investigate what the effect of different \textbf{R} sizes may be on our approach, but also provide biological starting points for any putative results. Additionally, this would be the first time marginal epistasis had been investigated on the pathway scale in human populations.

Running MAPIT-R on our UKB subsets across height and BMI, we find 245 pathways that are genome-wide significant for containing marginal epistatic interactions with the rest of the genome (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Barplots-KEGG}, Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Barplots-REACTOME}, and Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-TopPathways-KEGG-Height-a}\textcolor{blue}{-d}; $p$-value significance thresholds were determined using Bonferroni multiple testing correction based on the number of pathways tested per analysis). We find similar numbers of significant pathways between the KEGG and REACTOME databases, though KEGG contains more significant hits (130 vs. 115). And in both databases, we find that BMI contains more significant pathways than height (155 vs. 90). Interestingly, the vast majority of our significant pathways are identified in the African subset (165/245). This skew towards the African subset is found in each pathway database as well as in each phenotype.   

Looking at which specific pathways are significant in the African subset, we see multiple themes across each of the database and phenotype combinations (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-TopPathways-KEGG-BMI-a}\textcolor{blue}{-d}). In KEGG height, we find multiple pathways representing cellular signaling (e.g. KEGG\_CHEMOKINE\_SIGNALING\_PATHWAY, KEGG\_CYTOKINE\_CYTOKINE\_RECEPTOR\_INTERACTION, and \\ KEGG\_WNT\_SIGNALING\_PATHWAY), immune systems (e.g. \\ KEGG\_AUTOIMMUNE\_THYROID\_DISEASE, KEGG\_ALLOGRAFT\_REJECTION, and KEGG\_ANTIGEN\_PROCESSING\_AND\_PRESENTATION), and heart conditions (e.g. KEGG\_DILATED\_CARDIOMYOPATHY and \\ KEGG\_VIRAL\_MYOCARDITIS). In KEGG BMI, we find similar themes, as well as multiple pathways that involve metabolism (e.g. KEGG\_PURINE\_METABOLISM, KEGG\_BETA\_ALANINE\_METABOLISM, and \\ KEGG\_ETHER\_LIPID\_METABOLISM). REACTOME pathways show similar themes as well in both phenotypes.

\caption[TBD]{\textbf{Number of KEGG pathways that have significant marginal epistasis, per subset}. The figure shows the number of genome-wide significant pathways found from running MAPIT-R for height and BMI in the KEGG database on each of our UKB subsets. Results from the REACTOME database in height and BMI can be found in Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Barplots-REACTOME}. Genome-wide significance was determined by using Bonferroni-corrected $p$-value thresholds based on the number of pathways tested in each phenotype, subset, and pathway database combination. As shown in these results, we find across all phenotype and database combinations that the African subset has the largest numbers of significant pathways. For lists of the specific significant pathways per subset, phenotype, and database combination, see Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-TopPathways-KEGG-Height-a}\textcolor{blue}{-d}.}
\label{InterPath-Main-Figure-Barplots-KEGG}
\end{figure}

This abundance of signal in the African subset stands out since the African subset is neither our subset with the largest sample size or our subset with the largest number of SNPs (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). However simulations done under a number of biological scenarios show MAPIT-R behaves properly under the null.  (Supplementary Figure XX). Additionally, we used permuted phenotypes as another check of MAPIT-R's behavior under the null, and we indeed find this to be the case (Supplementary Figures \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-perm1-QQPlots-AllPaths} and \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-10perms-pValHists}); we also used these permutations to investigate MAPIT-R's false discovery rates and observe values only as high as 1.5\% across our multiple ancestry, phenotype, and pathway database combinations at different significance thresholds (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-AllPops-FDRs}).

\subsection{Beginning Examples of Ancestry-Level Differences in Epistatic Interactions}

Expanding beyond the results from our African subset, we see 80 other pathways that are significant across the other subpopulations. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the abundance of results from the African subset, many of these other results overlap with the set of significant pathways from the African subset (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Heatplots-KEGG} \& Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Heatplots-REACTOME}). For example, in the KEGG Height results the Caribbean subset overlaps with the African subset for 6 of its 7 pathways, and the Chinese subset overlaps with the African subset for 7 of its 8 pathways; interestingly, however, there is no overlap between the Chinese and Caribbean subsets. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.225]{Images/Main/InterPath_Main_Figure_Heatplots_KEGG_vs2.png}
\caption[TBD]{\textbf{Overlap of MAPIT-R significant KEGG pathways between UKB subsets}. The heatplots show the numbers of genome-wide significant MAPIT-R pathways that overlap between each UKB subset for height and BMI in the KEGG database. Results for both phenotypes in the REACTOME database can be seen in Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Heatplots-REACTOME}. The diagonal shows the total number of genome-wide significant pathways per population subset. We observe that most subsets often have overlap with the African subset but rarely do so with the remaining non-African subsets.}
\label{InterPath-Main-Figure-Heatplots-KEGG}
\end{figure}

Looking into the specific pathways in each of these overlaps, we find pathways moreso related to the cellular signaling and heart condition patterns from before in the overlap between the African and Caribbean subsets; additionally these overlaps appear to be driven by multiple kinases (eg MAPK1, ROCK1, PRKCB, PAK1) and calcium channel proteins (eg CACNA1S, CACNA1D) (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-MAPITR-TopPathway-Overlap} \& \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-MAPITR-TopPathway-GeneCounts-Overlap}). The overlap between the African and Chinese subsets however moreso contain pathways related to the immune system and appear to be driven primarily by multiple HLA loci (eg HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-A, HLA-B) (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-MAPITR-TopPathway-Overlap} \& \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-MAPITR-TopPathway-GeneCounts-Overlap}). These differences between ancestries may reflect heterogeneous power to detect epistatic signals. It is interesting to see the continual overlap between non-African subsets and the African subset, but less so between the non-African subsets. One possibility we may be witnessing is that pathways with the largest signals for marginal epistasis may be widely important biologically, hence seeing themes such as cellular signaling and the immune system. More population-specific signals may require greater sample sizes to identify. 

\subsection{BMI Contains Stronger Signals than Height for Marginal Epistatic Interactions}

Focusing once again on the African results, we observe in both the KEGG and REACTOME databases more significant pathways in BMI than Height. While there is a strong correlation between the MAPIT-R -$\log_{10}$ $p$-values of these two phenotypes (.851 in KEGG and .858 in REACTOME), we consistently see more significant signals in BMI (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African}). This may not be a surprising result since pedigree-based heritability estimates have suggested narrow-sense heritability is around .8 in height and between .4 and .6 in BMI \citep{Elks2012,Visscher2012}; this would suggest that non-additive effects may play a greater role in BMI than height, which aligns with our results here.

The $x$-axis is the MAPIT-R height -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value and the $y$-axis is the MAPIT-R BMI -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value. The dotted red lines are the Bonferroni-corrected $p$-value thresholds for genome-wide significance in each pathway and phenotype combination. The blue ellipse in the KEGG results highlight four pathways that appear to have much more significant BMI $p$-values than height $p$-values. In general though, across both pathway databases, we see more significant $p$-values in BMI than height.

\label{InterPath-Main-Figure-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African}
\end{figure}

Looking specifically at pathways that diverge in significance between height and BMI, we find one cluster of pathways in the KEGG results that separate out as particularly more significant in BMI than height. The four pathways circled in Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African}, sorted by decreasing -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value, are KEGG\_SMALL\_CELL\_LUNG\_CANCER, KEGG\_ERBB\_SIGNALING\_PATHWAY, KEGG\_NON\_SMALL\_CELL\_LUNG\_CANCER, and KEGG\_T\_CELL\_RECEPTOR\_SIGNALING\_PATHWAY. We once again see this theme of signaling pathways, but now also a trend of oncogenic pathways. Looking at the genes driving these pathways (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African-GeneCounts}), we find two sets of gene families that appear in all four pathways: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PIKs) and the AKT serine/threonine-protein kinases. One gene that stands out from this group is AKT2, a locus that has been associated with multiple monogenic disorders of glucose metabolism, including severe insulin resistance and diabetes, and severe fasting hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemia \citep{George2004,Manning2017,Latva-Rasku2018}. This gene is a strong candidate then for having epistatic interactions more relevant to BMI than height, possibly explaining this cluster of pathways.       

\subsection{The Proteasome is Enriched for Marginal Epistatic Interactions}

To look deeper into our African subset results, we were interested in whether any genes were significantly enriched across our top pathways. Finding genes that are significantly enriched could potentially provide greater insight into what biology is underlying our pathway results, or even identify new biological patterns all together. To accomplish this we began with the canonical approach of using the hypergeometric test for enrichment; here, we will compare the number of times a gene appears among our significant pathways against the number of times that gene appears in the full distribution of pathways in either the KEGG or REACTOME databases. 

Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-AllPops-TopGeneCounts-KEGG-Height-a}\textcolor{blue}{-d} shows the various genes present across our significant pathways at different levels of counts, and Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Hypergeometric-QQPlots-African} shows the QQ-plots of our hypergeometric enrichment results across these genes. What immediately stands out is the abundance of `significant' $p$-values we find. For example, using the conservative Bonferroni cutoff of $2.082\times10^{-5}$ (.05 / 2401 genes), we would identify 45 genes as being significantly enriched in the REACTOME BMI analysis. However, one major assumption underlying this test is that each pathway is independent from one another, and we know this to not be the case. In fact this assumption is being violated in two ways in regards to the distribution of pathways we are analyzing. 

First, we know that many pathways overlap one another in terms of gene content, and that this particular set of relationships is not easily deconstructed. Second, we also know that the hypothesis underlying our approach is that more SNPs should be correlated to greater levels of significance, and this is indeed what we observe in the results (Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-pValsVsNumSNPs}); across both phenotypes in both pathway databases, we observe significant relationships between MAPIT-R -$\log_{10}$ $p$-values and the number of SNPs present in an analyzed pathway. This is encouraging in that it supports our initial intuition, but it does lead to significant pathways being more likely to have many SNPs and genes. Therefore when we observe a gene as significantly enriched, it may be possible that the locus just happens to be present in many pathways due to the nature of its function, such as being a `housekeeping' gene. In this case, the enrichment may be less a reflection of our biological interest (genes enriched for epistatic interactions) and more a reflection of the quality of the pathway databases (larger pathways have more similar gene content than smaller pathways do).

The second of these two situations is what we tried to resolve first. If we are concerned about a relationship between larger pathways and inflated hypergeometric $p$-values, then one possible approach might be to restrict the size of the pathways analyzed. Instead of looking at enrichment among all pathways, we can instead look at enrichment only among pathways that have under a certain number of SNPs. And indeed, by restricting the number of SNPs present in a pathway to 1,000 or less, we see a major drop off in the number of significant pathways remaining (29 to 2 for KEGG height, 47 to 11 for KEGG BMI, 24 to 0 for REACTOME height, and 65 to 26 for REACTOME BMI); this, by extension, also produces a large drop in the genes that are present across these pathways as well as their associated hypergeometric $p$-values (Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Hypergeometric-RestrictedComps-African-BMI} and Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-Hypergeometric-RestrictedComps-African-BMI-TopExamples}). Interestingly however, we find one gene family that has had the opposite result -- multiple proteasome subunit genes (\textit{PSMA}*, \textit{PSMB}*, \textit{PSMC}*, \textit{PSMD}*, and \textit{PSME*}) now produce more significant hypergeometric $p$-values upon this restriction to pathways with smaller SNP counts (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-AllPops-TopGeneCount-HypergeometricTests}). 

The proteasome is one half of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a critical process for proper protein degradation and cell homeostasis \citep{Voges1999,Livneh2016,Collins2017}. And the genes highlighted in this size-restricted analysis represent both the core (20S) and regulatory cap (19S or 11S) subunits of the 26S proteasome, the main variant found within the cytosol of mammalian cells. Looking at the size-restricted pathways these genes are present in, we see multiple pathways related to cell-cycle regulation and, once again, the immune system (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-AllPops-TopGeneCount-SizeRestricted-Proteasome}). This new, first, category makes sense since protein levels (and therefore their regulation and degradation) are a key component of determining when cells progress through various cycle checkpoints. Encouragingly, these pathways also contain a range of SNP sizes, including multiple pathways with less than 600 SNPs -- this suggests that the results are not simply the product of finding pathways with the next largest set of allowable SNP sizes, but are instead being driven by other factors, such as possibly the underlying biology. More work will be needed to investigate whether these particular results are unique to BMI or are representative of a broadly important protein complex for many phenotypes. But overall these results suggest the proteasome is a prime candidate as a protein complex that is significantly enriched for marginal epistatic interactions.  

%To further look into these proteasome genes, we...

\subsection{Testing the Null Model with British Replicate Subpopulations}

One important consideration of our results is that we have limited representations of the different human ancestries we are analyzing. Are the samples we are analyzing large enough to be representative of the true total populations? While it is still difficult to address that question directly for non-European populations due to the limited availability of other public datasets, we are able to ask that question for the British ancestry subsets. Specifically, we can take additional, non-overlapping random subsets of 4,000 British individuals and see if they are at least consistent in their lack of results as compared to the original random subset. Furthermore, given the data availability, we also constructed sets of larger British subsamples to investigate the impact of sample size on our results as well. In total we analyzed 5 sets of 4,000 British individuals and 5 sets of 10,000 British individuals. 

And overall we see similar results across all replicates to our original results from the first set of 4,000 British individuals. We see limited numbers of significant pathways across all replicate subset, phenotype, and database pathway combinations, as well as limited overlap of significant pathways between replicates (Supplementary Figures \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-BritReps-Barplots}\textcolor{blue}{-13}). We also ran analyses using permuted phenotypes, as before, and once again see proper behavior under the null and very low FDRs (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Tables-BritReps-FDRs-pt1}). While not presenting new significant pathways, these results at least suggest that the large numbers of significant pathways we observe in the African subset are less likely to be a product of simply choosing a particularly optimal set of individuals by chance.  

\subsection{Investigating the Relationship Between Within-Population Genetic Structure and Detecting Epistasis}

It is clear that the African subset produces many more significant MAPIT-R results than any other subset in our analysis; an obvious next question then is: why? It is known that on average African populations harbor greater levels of genetic variation than other global human populations. It may be possible that having greater base levels of variation across the genome may provide more power for our approach. Therefore we began to investigate whether there were any links between different population genetic measures of genetic variation within our subsets and their respective MAPIT-R results.

Our first approach to investigate this question was to look at broadscale metrics of genetic variation across our population subsets. We did this by calculating both pairwise F\textsubscript{ST} values between each subset as well as PVE estimates for each subset's top 10 local principal components (Figures \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Fst} \& \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Eigenvalues}; `local' here refers to conducting PCA on each subset separately). For pairwise F\textsubscript{ST}, we find values as large as .124, which are within range of previous global sample estimates \citep{Ramachandran2005,Weir2005,Wang2012,Sugden2016}. We find that while the African subset does have some of the largest divergences from other populations (such as the British subsets), we also witness close to similar levels of divergence between the Chinese subset and other populations as well. In contrast, looking at the top local PC PVE estimates, we see a pattern of population differentiation that is more similar to our MAPIT-R results. The African subset has a PC1 PVE that is much greater than any other population, and the second highest population is the Caribbean cohort, which is also the population with the second most significant MAPIT-R results. We do witness however higher baseline levels of PVE across the other population subsets as compared to the African and Caribbean ones. These results suggest that what is driving our MAPIT-R results is not solely high levels of genetic variation or differentiation, but also a quality of how this variation is structured within a given population as well.

The heatplot shows pairwise F\textsubscript{ST} values between each of our UKB population subsets using our genome-wide SNP data. F\textsubscript{ST} values range from .001 to .124, and we observe typical global patterns (eg African/Caribbean vs. non-African subsets, Chinese vs. non-Asian subsets). These global patterns, however, do not match the distribution of total number of significant MAPIT-R pathways observed per-ancestry in Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Barplots-KEGG} and Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Barplots-REACTOME}.}

Local here continues to refer to calculating PCs by using each subset separately (versus jointly calculating PCs across all subsets together). We observe that the distribution of these PC1 PVEs among our subsets appears to correlate well with the distribution of total number of genome-wide significant MAPIT-R pathways we observe per subset (see Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Barplots-KEGG} and  Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Barplots-REACTOME}).}
\label{InterPath-Main-Figure-Eigenvalues}
\end{figure}

To take these analyses one step further, we investigated levels of genetic diversity on the pathway-scale as well to see if they are correlated with the MAPIT-R results. To accomplish this, we calculated the mean proportion of pairwise identity-by-state across every pair of individuals on the pathway level. Meaning for a single pathway, we had a metric ranging from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates all pairs of individuals had exactly the same genotypes at every SNP for a given pathway and 0 means all pairs of individuals had completely different genotypes at each of these SNPs. Lower values would then indicate greater levels of genetic diversity for a given pathway within that ancestry subset. Once we had these values, we then compared them against each pathway's MAPIT-R -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value; however, we found there was no relationship between these two metrics (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-IBS-African} \& Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-IBS-AllPops}). This was true across almost every combination of UKB population subsets, phenotype, and pathway database collections. And in directly comparing population subsets against one another, it can be seen that the per-pathway IBS proportions follow similar trajectories, shifted only by each population's mean level of IBS (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-IBS-AllPopComps-KEGG} \& Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-IBS-AllPopComps-REACTOME}). Therefore it appears this further supports our previous finding that the signal we are observing in our results is likely not being driven by broadscale levels of genetic variation. Instead, there may be a more cryptic structure and relationship between the genetic variation in each subset and the power to detect epistasis we are observing with MAPIT-R.

Results for each phenotype, pathway database, and subset combination can be found in Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-IBS-AllPops}. We observe across almost every combination no significant relationship between pathway mean pairwise IBS proportion and MAPIT-R $p$-value.}

\section{Discussion}\label{InterPath-Discussion}

Here we present the first exploration of marginal epistasis across multiple human ancestries. Specifically we investigate both single SNP and pathway level marginal epistasis in height and BMI, and present a novel framework for analyzing marginal epistasis in pathways. We find that our African subset is particularly well-powered to detect signals of pathway marginal epistasis, with this subset containing over 65\% of our 245 total genome-wide hits. We show that across many pathways BMI produces stronger signals of marginal epistasis than height. And lastly, we find evidence that cellular signaling and immune-related pathways may be particularly enriched for marginal epistasis, and the proteasome as a protein complex may be enriched for marginal epistatic interactions as well. 

The fact that we find such an abundance of results in the African UKB subset is not necessarily surprising. The notion that African populations may be particularly insightful for complex trait genetics is not novel \citep{Rotimi2017,Choudhury2018,Martin2018,Bentley2020}, with efforts delineating the genetic architecture of skin pigmentation \citep{Martin2017b,Crawford2017b} and the evolutionary histories of FOXP2 and other loci \citep{Atkinson2018,Sugden2018} being some recent examples. The question of what aspects of the greater genetic diversity observed in African populations is driving the results found here is still an area of future work. As we have found initially, it is unlikely that our results are due to broadscale differences between populations in pathway-level genetic variation alone. Instead, what we may be observing is differences in observable population structure leading to variation in the ability to correct for background noise; the higher PC1 PVE observed in the African population may be evidence that being able to remove a greater amount of structure from the data leads to more exposure of the underlying genetic signal. Future work based on these results should include further exploration of this connection between patterns of genetic variation and power to detect epistatic signals in the African subset.  

While the results presented here are encouraging on multiple levels, there are some limitations to the current analyses. One major future direction for work is the need for scaling these types of marginal epistasis methods. Similar to MAPIT, MAPIT-R currently does not scale well to the full sizes of current biobanks; in its current form MAPIT-R may begin to encounter burdensome computational times beyond 20,000 individuals. One potential avenue to overcome these issues is to incorporate the use of summary statistics for the analysis of marginal epistasis; moving from direct genotypes to GWA study summary statistics has proven useful in both speeding up computational time as well as increasing power in multiple other GWA contexts \citep{Shi2016,Johnson2018,Ray2018,Cheng2019,Turchin2019,Urbut2019}. Another limitation of MAPIT-R is that, as part of the marginal epistasis framework, it identifies whether a pathway contains any epistatic interactions with the rest of the genome. As shown here this has the advantage of accumulating signal over multiple variants, but it produces an ambiguous situation in terms of what regions of the genome to analyze \textit{a posteriori}. Extending or linking MAPIT-R with a framework that explicitly follows up marginal epistasis signals with locus-focused methods such as fine-mapping \citep{Kichaev2014,Chen2015,Benner2016} or co-localization \citep{Hormozdiari2016,Zhu2016,Wen2017,Giambartolomei2018,Wallace2020} may further expand the power of the marginal epistasis approach.  

\section{Methods}\label{InterPath-Online-Methods}

\subsection{UK BioBank Data}

\subsubsection{Population Subsets}

To create the UKB population subsets used in this study, we first extracted and grouped individuals by the self-identified ancestries of `African', `British', `Caribbean', `Chinese', `Indian', and `Pakistani'. British random subsets of 4,000 and 10,000 individuals, both the original sets and the additional four rounds of replications, were constructed by randomly choosing initial sets of non-overlapping 4,000 and 10,000 individuals. Standard quality control (QC) procedures were then employed on each population subset (see Supplementary Note for details) on both the variant and individual levels, pre-PCA. Local PCA was then conducted to confirm ancestry groupings and remove outliers, and a last round of QC was conducted post-PCA as well. Note that the genetic data used in these analyses were the directly genotyped variant sets  from the UKB after running imputation on the University of Michigan Imputation Server \citep{Das2016}; most of the analyses in this manuscript utilize genetic relatedness matrices (GRMs), and GRMs require zero genotype missingness. To minimize the loss of SNPs while meeting this threshold we chose to impute missing genotypes while still focusing on just the original set of genotyped variants. For metrics and PCA plots of the final, post-QC set of UKB individuals, see Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-UKB-Subsets-PCAPlot} and Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}. 

\subsubsection{Phenotypes}

For the analyses presented in this study we focused on the complex traits of height and BMI. Each phenotype was adjusted for age, gender, and assessment center. Following previous pipelines \citep{Wood2014,Locke2015}, each dataset was first divided into males and females. Age was then regressed out within each sex, and the resulting residuals were inverse normalized. These normalized values were then combined back together between sexes and, lastly, assessment center designations were regressed out. 

\subsection{PLINK Analyses}

PLINK pairwise epistasis analyses were conducted using PLINK v1.90b4 \citep{Purcell2007}, the `\texttt{-{}-epistasis}' command, and phenotypes that had top 10 local PCs regressed out; PCs were regressed out directly from the phenotypes due to the `\texttt{-{}-epistasis}' function having no explicit form to incorporate covariates. Default values for the `\texttt{-{}-epi1}' and `\texttt{-{}-epi2}' options (0.0001 and 0.01, respectively) were kept.   

\subsection{MAPIT Analyses}

MAPIT analyses were conducted using the MAPIT software downloaded from \url{https://github.com/lorinanthony/MAPIT}. MAPIT was run using the phenotypes as previously described and top 10 local PCs as covariates. Specifically, we used the `\texttt{MAPIT\_Davies\_Approx}' function due to its computational speed up and because our datasets had large enough sample sizes to properly employ the approximate form.  






\subsection{MAPIT-R Model}

We describe the framework for ``\underline{Inter}actions in \underline{Path}way'' (MAPIT-R) analysis in detail here. The key goal of this method is to identify crosstalk between signaling pathways in GWA studies, without having to explicitly model all possible higher-order interactions. In general, consider a pathway which is defined by a set of SNPs found within the regulatory regions of genes in that pathway. We will denote these variants with the set of indices $\mathcal{R} = (r_1,\ldots,r_p)$. Begin by considering the following partitioned linear regression model,
\begin{equation}\label{LM}
\by = \mu\bm{1}+\sum_{r\in \mathcal{R}}\bx_r\beta_{r}+\sum_{s\not\in \mathcal{R}}\bx_s\beta_{s}+\bvarepsilon, \quad \bvarepsilon\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \tau^2\bI),
\end{equation}
where $\by$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of quantitative phenotypes for $n$ individuals; $\mu$ is an intercept term with an $n$-dimensional vector of ones; $\bx_r$ and $\bx_s$ are $n$-dimensional genotype vectors for variants that lie within and outside the regulatory region $\mathcal{R}$, respectively; $\beta_r$ and $\beta_s$ are the corresponding additive effect sizes; $\bvarepsilon$ is an $n$-vector of residual errors; $\tau^2$ is the residual error variance; $\bI$ denotes the identity matrix; and $\mathcal{N}(\bullet,\bullet)$ denotes a multivariate normal distribution. Here, we also assume that the genotypic vectors have been centered and standardized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

Because we consider scenarios where there are more variants than samples, we need to specify additional modeling assumptions in Equation \eq{LM} to make the rest of the model identifiable. In particular, we recall previous approaches and assume that the individual effect sizes follow univariate normal distributions, or $\beta_r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \omega^2/p)$ and $\beta_s \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2/(l-p))$, where $l$ is the number of total number of all SNPs \citep{Crawford2017a}. With the assumption of normally distributed effect sizes, the model defined in Equation \eq{LM} is equivalent to a variance component model where $\bg\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \omega^2\bK)$ with $\bK=\bX_{\mathcal{R}}\bX_{\mathcal{R}}^{\T}/p$ being the genetic relatedness matrix computed using genotypes from all variants within the signaling pathway of interest; and $\wt\bg\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \nu^2\wt\bK)$ with $\wt\bK=\bX_{-\mathcal{R}}\bX_{-\mathcal{R}}^{\T}/(l-p)$ representing a relatedness matrix computed using all other variants. Note that $\bg$ may be interpreted as a pathway's additive effect, while $\wt\bg$ denotes its polygenic background. 

To complete the specification of the MAPIT-R methodology, we lastly assume an additional random effect $\bu$ which models the summation of all pairwise interaction effects between a given signaling pathway variant and all other pathways. In this work, we limit ourselves to the case of finding second order crosstalk relationships between pathways --- although, extensions to higher-order interactions is straightforward \citep{Crawford2017a}. Altogether, this results in the following linear mixed model
\begin{equation}
\by = \mu\bm{1}+ \bg +\wt\bg+\bu+\bvarepsilon,\\ 
\bg\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \omega^2\bK), \quad \wt\bg\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0},
\nu^2\wt\bK),\\ 
\bu\sim\mathcal{N}(\bm{0},\sigma^2\bQ), \quad \bvarepsilon\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \tau^2\bI).\label{LMM}
\end{equation}
Here, the $\bQ = \bK\circ\wt\bK$ is represents a second-order interaction relationship matrix, and is obtained by using the Hadamard product (i.e.~the squaring of each element) between the pathway specific relatedness matrix and its corresponding polygenic background. Note that the formulation of MAPIT-R in Equation \eq{LMM} can easily be extended to accommodate other fixed effects (e.g.~age, sex, or genotype principal components), as well as other random effects terms that can be used to account for sample non-independence due to other genetic or common environmental factors.

%Note that we make the assumption that each $\bg_k^{(l)}\sim \mbox{MVN}(\bm{0}, \sigma_{l}^2\bK^l_k)$, where the baseline covariance matrix $\bK_k=\bX_{-\mathcal{R}}\bX_{-\mathcal{R}}^{\T}/p_k$ is the conventional genetic relatedness matrix computed using genotypes from all $p_k$ variants outside of the region $\mathcal{R}$. Here, we use the power factor $l$ to denote the order of interaction (epistatic) effects that are accounted for within the model. For example, when $l=2$, $\mathbf{K}_k^2 = \mathbf{K}_k\circ\mathbf{K}_k$ represents a pairwise interaction relationship matrix, and is obtained by using the Hadamard product (i.e.~the squaring of each element) of the linear kernel matrix with itself \citep{Henderson:1985aa,Ronnegard:2008aa,Jiang:2015aa}. In this case, $\mathbf{K}_k^2$ denotes the marginal second order epistatic effect of the $k$\textsuperscript{th} functional marker under the polygenic background of all other markers. It is important to note that each $\bK_k^{l}$ changes with every new gene, protein, or pathway $k$ that is considered.

\subsection{Hypothesis Testing for Interaction Effects}

Our goal is to identify signaling pathways that have significant non-zero interaction effects on a given phenotype. To do so, we examine each $r$-th pathway of interest in turn, and test the null hypothesis in Equation \eqref{LMM} that $\text{H}_0: \sigma^2=0$. The variance component $\sigma^2$ effectively captures the total interaction effects between the $r$-th pathway and all other pathways. We refer to this as the marginal interaction effect for the $r$-th pathway. To do so, we make use of the MQS method for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing \citep{Zhou2017}. Briefly, MQS is based on the computationally efficient method of moments and produces estimates that are mathematically identical to the Haseman-Elston (HE) cross-product regression \citep{Haseman1972}. To estimate the variance components with MQS, we first multiply Equation \eq{LMM} by a projection (hat) matrix onto the null space of the intercept term $\mu$, where $\bH=\bI-\bm{1}(\bm{1}^{\T}\bm{1})^{-1}\bm{1}^{\T}$. After this projection procedure, we obtain a simplified linear mixed model 
\begin{equation}
\by^*_r = \bg^*_r +\wt\bg^*_r+\bu^*_r+\bvarepsilon^*_r\\ 
\bg_r\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \omega^2\bK^*_r), \quad \wt\bg_r\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \nu^2\wt\bK^*_r),\\ \bu_r\sim\mathcal{N}(\bm{0},\sigma^2\bQ^*_r), \quad \bvarepsilon_r\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \tau^2\bH) \label{LMM2}
\end{equation}
where $\by^*_r=\bH\by$; $\bg^*_r = \bH\bg_r$; $\bK^*_r = \bH\bK_r\bH$; $\wt\bg_r^* = \bH\wt\bg_r$; $\wt\bK_r^* = \bH\wt\bK_r\bH$; $\bu^*_r = \bH\bu_r$; $\bQ^*_r = \bH\bQ_r\bH$; and $\bvarepsilon_r^* = \bH_r\bvarepsilon$, respectively. Then for each pathway considered, the MQS estimate for the marginal interaction effect is computed as
\begin{equation}
\wh\sigma^2 = \by^{*\T}_r\bA_r\by
\end{equation}
where $\bA_{r} = (\bS_r^{-1})_{31}\bK_r^*+(\bS_r^{-1})_{32}\wt\bK_r^*+(\bS_r^{-1})_{33}\bQ^*_r+(\bS_r^{-1})_{34}\bH$ with elements $(\bS_r)_{jk} = \tr(\bSigma_{rj} \bSigma_{rk})$ for the covariances matrices subscripted as $[\bSigma_{r1}; \bSigma_{r2}; \bSigma_{r3}; \bSigma_{r4}]  = [\bK^*_r; \wt\bK^*_r; \bQ^*_r; \bH]$. Here, $\tr(\bullet)$ is used to denote the matrix trace function. It has been shown that, under MQS, a given marginal variance component estimate $\wh\sigma^2$ follows a mixture of chi-square distributions under the null hypothesis \citep{Crawford2017a}. Namely, $\wh\sigma^2 \sim \sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\chi^2_{1,i}$, where $\chi^2_{1}$ are chi-square random variables with one degree of freedom and $(\lambda_{1},\ldots,\lambda_{n})$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix 
\begin{equation*}
\left(\wh\omega^2_{0}\bK^*_r+\wh\nu^2_{0}\wt\bK^*_r+\wh\tau^2_{0}\bH\right)^{1/2} \bA_{r}\left(\wh\omega^2_{0}\bK^*_r+\wh\nu^2_{0}\wt\bK^*_r+\wh\tau^2_{0}\bH\right)^{1/2}

with $(\wh\omega^2_{0},\wh\nu^2_{0},\wh\tau^2_{0})$ being the MQS estimates of $(\omega^2,\nu^2,\tau^2)$ under the null hypothesis. Several approximation and exact methods have been suggested to obtain p-values under the distribution of $\wh\sigma^2$. One frequented choice is Davies exact method \citep{Davies1980,Wu2011}. 

%\subsection*{Hypothesis Testing for Overall Associations}

%FORCE also provides an option for summarizing overall marker enrichment. Here, we assume that we have already computed the $q$ marginal effect p-values for genetic marker $k$, denoted as $\wh\bp_k = (\wh p_{k1},\ldots,\wh p_{kq})$. Let $\wh\balpha_k^* = F^{-1}(\wh\bp_k)$ be the transformed test statistic where $F^{-1}$ is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard chi-square $\chi^2_1$. We follow previous works and define the sum of the correlated chi-square variables for a given functional genomic marker as \citep{Nakka:2016aa}
%\begin{equation}
%\bar{\alpha}_k^* = \sum_{l=1}^{q}\wh\alpha_{k,l}^*.\label{Comp}
%\end{equation}
%(NOTE: Follow the rest of the language from methods in PEGASUS here).
