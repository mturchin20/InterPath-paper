\section*{Abstract}\label{InterPath-Abstract} 

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified thousands of significant genetic associations in humans across a number of complex traits. However, the majority of these studies focus on linear additive relationships between genotypic and phenotypic variation. Epistasis, or non-additive genetic interactions, has been identified as a major driver of both complex trait architecture and evolution in multiple model organisms; yet, this same phenomenon is not considered to be a significant factor underlying human complex traits. There are two possible reasons for this assumption. First, most large GWA studies are conducted solely with European cohorts; therefore, our understanding of broad-sense heritability for many complex traits is limited to just one ancestry group. Second, current epistasis mapping methods commonly identify significant genetic interactions by exhaustively searching across all possible pairs of SNPs. In these frameworks, estimated epistatic effects size are often small and power can be low due to the multiple testing burden. Here, we present a case study that uses a novel region-based mapping approach to analyze functionally interacting sets of variants for the presence of epistatic effects across six diverse subgroups within the UK Biobank. We refer to this method as the ``MArginal ePIstasis Test for Regions'' or MAPIT-R. Even with limited sample sizes, we find a total of 245 pathways within the KEGG and REACTOME databases that are significantly enriched for epistatic effects in height and body mass index (BMI), with 67\% of these pathways being detected within individuals of African ancestry. As a secondary analysis, we introduce a novel region-based `leave-one-out' approach to localize pathway-level epistatic signals to specific interacting genes in BMI. Overall, our results indicate that non-European ancestry populations may be better suited for the discovery of non-additive genetic variation in human complex traits --- further underscoring the need for publicly available, biobank-sized datasets of diverse groups of individuals.

\section*{Introduction}\label{InterPath-Introduction}

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are a powerful tool for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and phenotypes \cite{Buniello2019}. The most common approach for conducting GWA studies is to use a linear mixed model to test for statistical associations, where the estimated regression coefficients represent an additive relationship between number of copies of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the phenotypic state. While this approach has produced many statistically significant additive associations, it is less amenable to detecting nonlinear genetic associations that also contribute to a trait's genetic architecture. Epistasis, commonly defined as the nonlinear, or non-additive, interaction between multiple genetic variants, is a well-established phenomenon in a number of model organisms \cite{Lehner2006,Rowe2008,Shao2008,Flint2009,Costanzo2010,He2010,Jarvis2011,Pettersson2011,Bloom2013,Monnahan2015}. Epistasis has also been suggested as a major driver of both phenotypic variation and evolution \cite{Carlborg2004,Carlborg2006,Martin2007,Phillips2008,Moore2009,Zuk2012,Jones2014,Mackay2014}. Still, there remains skepticism and controversy regarding the importance of epistasis in human complex traits and diseases \cite{Hill2008,Crow2010,Yang2010,Aschard2012,Powell2013,Maki-Tanila2014,Wood2014a,Yang2015}. For example, multiple studies have suggested that phenotypic variation can be mainly explained with additive effects \cite{Hill2008,Crow2010,Maki-Tanila2014}; although, this hypothesis has been been challenged recently \cite{Huang2016}). In initial work to locate the  ``missing heritability'' in the human genome --- the discrepancy between larger pedigree-based trait heritability estimates and smaller SNP-based trait heritability estimates using the first wave of human GWA study results \cite{Maher2008,Manolio2009,Eichler2010} --- it was suggested that epistasis may account for a significant portion of this observed discrepancy \cite{Slatkin2009,Zuk2012,Hemani2013}. However, other studies have posited that, for at least some human phenotypes, genetic interactions are unlikely to be a major contributor to total heritability \cite{Yang2015}.

% Something about lack of multiethnic studies here %

Algorithmically, detecting statistically significant epistatic signals via genome-wide scans is much more computationally expensive than the the traditional hypothesis-generating GWA framework. GWA tests for additive effects are linear in the number of SNPs, while epistasis scans usually consider, at a minimum, all pairwise combinations of SNPs (e.g., a total of $J(J - 1)/2$ possible pairwise combinations for $J$ variants in a study). Methods that fall within the MArginal ePIstasis Test (MAPIT) framework \cite{Crawford2017a,Crawford2018b,Moore2019,Wang2019} attempt to address these challenges by alternatively testing for \textit{marginal} epistasis. Specifically, instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, these approaches focus on identifying variants that have a non-zero interaction effect with any other variant in the data. Indeed, analyzing epistasis among pairs of SNPs can be underpowered in GWA studies, particularly when applied to polygenic traits or traits which are generated by many mutations of small effect \cite{Zhou2013,Yang2014,Bulik-Sullivan2015,Wray2018}. To overcome this limitation, more recent computational approaches have expanded the additive GWA framework to aggregate across multiple SNP-level association signals and test for the enrichment of genes and pathways \cite{Subramanian2005,Cantor2010,Wang2010b,Lee2012,Carbonetto2013,Mooney2014,Gamazon2015,de2016,Nakka2016,Zhu2018,Sun2019,Cheng2020}. 

In this study, our objective is to expand the marginal epistasis framework from individual SNPs to user-specified sets of variants (e.g., genes, signaling pathways). Here, we aim to detect novel interactions between biologically relevant disease mechanisms underlying complex traits and to analyze multiple human ancestries, all while reducing the multiple testing burden that traditionally hinders exhaustive epistatic scans. We implement our new approach in ``MArginal ePIstasis Test for Regions'', which we refer to as MAPIT-R. We apply MAPIT-R using pathway annotations from the ``Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes`` (KEGG) and REACTOME databases \cite{Liberzon2011} to standing height and body mass index (BMI) assayed in individuals from multiple human ancestry ``subgroups'' (British, African, Caribbean, Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani) in the UK Biobank \cite{Sudlow2015}. We analyze multiple non-European human ancestries to study if different genomic backgrounds might reveal varying contributions of epistatic interactions to phenotypic variation. We find more than 200 pathways spanning over all cohorts that have significant marginal epistatic effects on standing height and BMI. We then investigate the distribution of these significant non-additive signals across ancestries, traits, and pathways, which suggests future directions to prioritize for studies of epistasis in human complex traits.

\section*{Materials and Methods} 

\subsection*{Overview of the MAPIT-R Model}

We describe the intuition behind the ``MArginal ePIstasis Test for Regions'' (MAPIT-R) in detail here. Consider a genome-wide association (GWA) study with $N$ individuals. Within this study, we assume that we have an $N$-dimensional vector of quantitative traits $\by$, an $N\times J$ matrix of genotypes $\bX$, with $J$ denoting the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoded as $\{0,1,2\}$ copies of a reference allele at each locus, and a list of $L$ predefined genomic regions of interests $\{\mathcal{R}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{R}_L\}$. We will let each genomic region $l$ represent a known collection of annotated SNPs $j\in\mathcal{R}_l$ with set cardinality $|\mathcal{R}_l|$. In this work, \textcolor{red}{each $\mathcal{R}_l$ can include non-contiguous sets of SNPs across the genome}. \textcolor{red}{Additionally, }each $\mathcal{R}_l$ includes sets of SNPs that fall within \textcolor{red}{functional regions} of genes that have been annotated as being members of certain pathways or gene sets \textcolor{red}{(see Supplementary Note)}. Recall that our objective is to test whether a set of biologically relevant variants have a nonzero interaction effect with any other region along the genome. Therefore, MAPIT-R works by examining one region at a time (indexed by $l$) and fits the following linear mixed model
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\by = \mu + \bu_l + \bfm_l + \bg_l +\bvarepsilon, \quad\quad \bvarepsilon\sim\N(\bm{0},\tau^2\bI)\label{mapit_r}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\mu$ is an intercept term; $\bx_j$ is an $N$-dimensional genotypic vector for the $j$-th variant in the $l$-th region that is the focus of the model; $\bu_l = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}_l}\bx_j\beta_j$ is the summation of region-specific effects with corresponding additive effect sizes $\beta_j$ for the $j$-th variant; $\bfm_l = \sum_{k\ne\mathcal{R}_l}\bx_k\beta_k$ is the combined additive effects from all other $k\not\in\mathcal{R}_l$ SNPs in the data that have not been annotated as being within the $\mathcal{R}_l$ region of interest with coefficients $\beta_k$; $\bg_l = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}_l}\sum_{k\not\in\mathcal{R}_l}(\bx_j\circ\bx_k)\theta_{jk}$ is the summation of all pairwise interaction effects (i.e., the Hadamard product $\bx_j\circ\bx_k$) between the $j$-th variant in the $l$-th annotated region $\mathcal{R}_l$ and all other $k\ne j$ variants outside of $\mathcal{R}_l$ with corresponding coefficients $\theta_{jk}$; and $\bvarepsilon$ is a normally distributed error term with mean zero and independent residual error variance scaled by the component $\tau^2$. There are a few important takeaways from this formulation of MAPIT-R. First, the term $\bfm_l$ effectively represents the polygenic background of all variants except for those that have been annotated for the $l$-th region of interest. Second, and most importantly, the term $\bg_l$ is the main focus of the model and represents the \textit{marginal epistatic} effect of the region $\mathcal{R}_l$ \cite{Crawford2017a,Crawford2018b}. It is important to note that each component of the model will change with every new region that is considered.

For convenience, we assume that both the genotype matrix (column-wise) and the trait of interest have been mean-centered and standardized to have unit variance. Next, because the model in Eq.~\eq{mapit_r} is an underdetermined linear system ($J > N$), we ensure identifiability by assuming that the individual regression coefficients follow univariate normal distributions where 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\beta_j\sim \N(0,\nu^2/|\mathcal{R}_l|) \quad \quad \beta_k\sim\N(0,\omega^2/(J-|\mathcal{R}_l|)) \quad \quad \theta_{jk}\sim\N(0,\sigma^2/(J-|\mathcal{R}_l|)).\label{coef}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
With the assumption of normally distributed effect sizes, the MAPIT-R model defined in Eq.~\eq{mapit_r} becomes a multiple variance component model where $\bu_l\sim\N(\bm{0},\nu^2\bK_l)$ with $\bK_l = \bX_{\mathcal{R}_l}\bX_{\mathcal{R}_l}^{\T}/|\mathcal{R}_l|$ being the genetic relatedness matrix computed using genotypes from all variants within the region of interest; $\bfm_l \sim \N(\bm{0}, \omega^2\bV_l)$ with $\bV_l = \bX_{-\mathcal{R}_l}\bX_{-\mathcal{R}_l}^{\T}/(J-|\mathcal{R}_l|)$ being the genetic relatedness matrix computed using genotypes outside the region of interest; and $\bg_l \sim \N(\bm{0},\sigma^2\bG_l)$ with $\bG_l = \bK_l \circ \bV_l$ representing a second-order interaction relationship matrix which is obtained by using the Hadamard product (i.e., the squaring of each element) between the region-specific relatedness matrix and its corresponding polygenic background. Importantly, the variance component $\sigma^2$ effectively captures the marginal epistatic effect for the $l$-th region. Even though we limit ourselves to the task of identifying second order (i.e., pairwise) epistatic relationships between sets of SNPs in this paper, extensions to higher-order and gene-by-environmental interactions are straightforward to implement for alternative analyses \cite{Jiang2015,Crawford2017a,Zhou2017,Crawford2018a,Moore2019}.

\subsection*{Hypothesis Testing with the MAPIT-R Framework}

In this section, we now describe how to perform joint estimation of the all variance component parameters in the MAPIT-R model. Since our goal is to identify genomic regions that have significant non-zero interaction effects on a given phenotype, we examine each annotated SNP-set $l = 1,\ldots, L$ in turn, and test the null hypothesis in Eq.~\eq{mapit_r} and Eq.~\eq{coef} that $H_0: \sigma^2=0$. We make use of the MQS method for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing \cite{Zhou2017}. Briefly, MQS is based on the computationally efficient method of moments and produces estimates that are mathematically identical to the Haseman-Elston (HE) cross-product regression \cite{Haseman1972}. To estimate the variance components with MQS, we first multiply both sides of Eq.~\eq{mapit_r} by a projection (hat) matrix such that the model becomes orthogonal to the column space of the intercept term $\mu$. Specifically, we define $\bH=\bI-\bm{1}(\bm{1}^{\T}\bm{1})^{-1}\bm{1}^{\T}$ and obtain a simplified model
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\by^* = \bu_l^* + \bfm_l^* + \bg_l^* +\bvarepsilon^*, \quad \, \quad  \bvarepsilon\sim \N(\bm{0},\tau^2\bH)\label{mapit_r2}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{1}$ is an $N$-dimensional vector of ones; $\by^* = \bH\by$ is the projected phenotype of interest; $\bu_l^*\sim \N(\bm{0},\nu^2\bK_l^*)$ with $\bK_l^* = \bH\bK_l\bH$; $\bfm_l^*\sim \N(\bm{0},\omega^2\bV_l^*)$ with $\bV_l^* = \bH\bV_l\bH$; $\bg_l^*\sim \N(\bm{0},\sigma^2\bG_l^*)$ with $\bG_l^* = \bH\bG_l\bH$; and $\bvarepsilon^* = \bH\bvarepsilon$ is the projected residual error, respectively. Then for each annotation considered, the MQS estimate for the marginal epistatic effect is computed as
\begin{equation}
\wh\sigma^2 = \by^{*\T}\bA_l\by^*
\end{equation}
where $\bA_{l} = (\bS_l^{-1})_{31}\bK_l^*+(\bS_l^{-1})_{32}\bV_l^*+(\bS_l^{-1})_{33}\bG^*_l+(\bS_l^{-1})_{34}\bH$ with elements $(\bS_l)_{jk} = \tr(\bSigma_{lj} \bSigma_{lk})$ for the covariance matrices subscripted as $[\bSigma_{l1}; \bSigma_{l2}; \bSigma_{l3}; \bSigma_{l4}]  = [\bK^*_l; \bV^*_l; \bG^*_l; \bH]$. Here, $\tr(\bullet)$ is used to denote the matrix trace function. It has been well established that the marginal variance component estimate $\wh\sigma^2$ follows a mixture of chi-square distributions under the null hypothesis because of its quadratic form and the assumed normally distributed trait $\by$ \cite{Liu2010,Wu2011,Lee2012,Ionita-Laza2013,Crawford2017a,Wang2017}. Namely, $\wh\sigma^2 \sim \sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\chi^2_{1,i}$, where $\chi^2_{1}$ are chi-square random variables with one degree of freedom and $(\lambda_{1},\ldots,\lambda_{n})$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix \cite{Crawford2017a,Zhou2017}
\begin{equation*}
\left(\wh\nu^2_{0}\bK^*_l+\wh\omega^2_{0}\bV^*_l+\wh\tau^2_{0}\bH\right)^{1/2}\bA_{l}\left(\wh\nu^2_{0}\bK^*_l+\wh\omega^2_{0}\bV^*_l+\wh\tau^2_{0}\bH\right)^{1/2} 
\end{equation*}
with $(\wh\nu^2_{0},\wh\omega^2_{0},\wh\tau^2_{0})$ being the MQS estimates of $(\nu^2,\omega^2,\tau^2)$ under the null hypothesis. Several approximation and exact methods have been suggested to obtain $p$-values under the distribution of $\wh\sigma^2$. In this paper, we use the Davies exact method \cite{Davies1980,Wu2011}. 

\subsection*{Software Availability}

Code for implementing the ``MArginal ePIstasis Test for Regions'' (MAPIT-R) is freely available in \texttt{R}/\texttt{Rcpp} and is located at \url{https://github.com/mturchin20/MAPITR}. All MAPIT-R functions use the \texttt{CompQuadForm} \texttt{R} package to compute $p$-values with the Davies method. Note that the Davies method can sometimes yield a $p$-value that exactly equals 0. This can occur when the true $p$-value is extremely small \cite{Chen2013}. In this case, we report $p$-values as being truncated at $1\times10^{-10}$. Alternatively, one could also compute $p$-values for all MAPIT-R based functions using Kuonen's saddlepoint method \cite{Chen2013,Kuonen1999} or Satterthwaite's approximation equation \cite{Satterthwaite1946}.

\subsection*{SNP-Set and Pathway Annotations}

To create appropriate pathway annotations for MAPIT-R, we first assign SNP to genes and then aggregate the genes together according to pathway definitions provided by the KEGG and REACTOME databases, respectively. KEGG and REACTOME pathway definitions were downloaded and extracted from the Broad Institute's Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB; \url{https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp#C2}) under the collection ``C2: Curated Gene Sets'' \cite{Liberzon2011}. SNPs were annotated using \texttt{Annovar} \cite{Wang2010a} and were then mapped to a given gene if they were exonic, intronic, in the 5' and 3' UTRs, and 20kb upstream or downstream of the gene.

\subsection*{UK Biobank Data} 

To create the UK Biobank population subgroups used in this study \textcolor{red}{(UK Biobank Proposal XXXXX)}, we first extracted and grouped individuals by the self-identified ancestries of ``African'', ``British'', ``Caribbean'', ``Chinese'', ``Indian'', and ``Pakistani''. \textcolor{red}{For the British subgroups, five sets of 4,000 and 10,000 non-overlapping individuals were created, with one set from each sample size used for primary analyses and the remaining four from each sample sized used for replication analyses.} Standard quality control procedures were applied to each population subgroup (see Supplementary Note for details). Local principal component analysis (PCA) was then conducted to confirm ancestry groupings and to remove outliers. Note that the genetic data we used in this study were the directly genotyped variant sets from the UK Biobank after running imputation of missing genotypes on the University of Michigan Imputation Server \cite{Das2016}; \textcolor{red}{imputation was conducted manually so that an ancestry diverse and sample size balanced reference panel (1000G Phase 3 v5) could be implemented}. For \textcolor{red}{details} and \textcolor{red}{global} PCA plots of the final UK Biobank dataset, see Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-UKB-subgroups-PCAPlot} and Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}. Lastly, both the standing height and body mass index (BMI) traits were adjusted for age, gender, and assessment center. Following previous pipelines \cite{Wood2014a,Locke2015}, each dataset was first divided into males and females. Age was then regressed out within each sex, and the resulting residuals were inverse normalized. These normalized values were then combined back together between sexes and, lastly, assessment center designations were regressed out. \textcolor{red}{Top 10 `local' principal components (PCs) were included as covariates during the actual MAPIT-R analyses; `local' here refers to conducting PCA within each subgroup individually versus the `global' set up from before of conducting PCA on every subgroup together jointly}. For analyses using permuted phenotypes, permutations were conducted within-subgroup and done by randomly reassigning phenotypes to individuals.

\subsection*{Multiethnic Analyses Enables the Detection of Pathway-Level Interactions}\label{InterPath-Results-PathwayEpistasis}

We applied MAPIT-R to height and body mass index (BMI) to detect pathways from the KEGG and REACTOME databases \cite{Liberzon2011} with significant epistatic interactions with other regions on the genome, using genotype data and diverse individuals from the UK Biobank. We focused on height and BMI due to the extensive work that has already been done investigating the broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities of these traits \cite{Yang2010,Elks2012,Visscher2012,Finucane2015,Speed2017,Wainschtein2019}, and we used the KEGG and REACTOME databases because they cover an extensive range of both biological processes and pathway-sizes (measured in SNP counts). We analyzed six different human ancestry subgroups that we extracted from the UK Biobank: African ($N=$ 3111), British ($N=$ 3848, chosen randomly from the full $N=$ 442,688 cohort), Caribbean ($N=$ 3833), Chinese ($N=$ 1448), Indian ($N=$ 5077), and Pakistani ($N=$ 1581) (Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-UKB-subgroups-PCAPlot} and Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). Subgroups were extracted based on self-identified ancestry and individuals were filtered using standard quality control procedures (see Supplementary Note for details).

Applying MAPIT-R to height and BMI within each ancestry subgroups, we find a total of 245 enriched pathways that have genome-wide significant signals for marginal epistatic interactions with the rest of the genome (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Barplots-KEGG}, Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Barplots-REACTOME}, and Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-TopPathways-AllPaths-AllPhenos}) Here, $p$-value significance thresholds were determined by using Bonferroni multiple testing correction based on the number of pathways tested per analysis (see Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). Overall, a similar number of pathways were statistically enriched between the KEGG and REACTOME databases (130 and 115, respectively); however, we find that BMI yielded more non-additive genetic signal than height (155 versus 90 significant pathways, respectively). Most notably, the majority of our results occurred within the African subgroup of the data: 165 out of 245 significant pathways across all analyses. Indeed, our findings across each ancestry-specific subgroup overlap with results from other work showing evidence for the importance of epistasis in human immunity, particularly involving the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) \cite{Martin2002,Williams2005,Wan2010,Rose2012,Lareau2016,Opi2018,Zhang2019}, as well as the key roles metabolic processes and cellular signaling play in trait architecture for model systems \cite{Segre2005,Snitkin2011,Podgornaia2015,Sorrells2015,Tyler2017,Nghe2018,Jiao2019}. 

The enriched pathways for the African subgroup represent multiple biologically relevant themes in both height and BMI (Table \ref{InterPath-Main-Table-KEGG-African-TopPathways-Themes} and Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-TopPathways-AllPaths-AllPhenos}). When analyzing height with annotations from the KEGG database, we find that most of the statistically significant marginal epistatic interactions occur in pathways related to canonical signaling cascades, functions within the immune system, and sets of genes that affect heart conditions. For example, previous multiethnic GWA studies have found additive associations to height with cytokine genes \cite{Marouli2017}, signaling of WNT/beta-catenin \cite{Wood2014b}. Results from MAPIT-R suggest that both interactions involving cytokine receptors ($p$-value $= 2.84\times 10^{-8}$) and genes within the WNT-signaling pathway ($p$-value $= 6.54\times 10^{-6}$) also contribute to the broad-sense heritability and complex genetic architecture of height as well. In BMI, we find similar themes, as well as multiple statistically significant hits from metabolic pathways (Table \ref{InterPath-Main-Table-KEGG-African-TopPathways-Themes}). Notably, MAPIT-R identified functions such as ErbB signaling ($p$-value $= 3.30\times 10^{-7}$) and ether lipid metabolism ($p$-value $= 1.41\times 10^{-4}$) as having significant marginal epistatic effects, which are also two mechanisms that have been shown to have additive associations in BMI \cite{Locke2015,Salinas2016,Jha2018}. 

It is important to note that, in our analyses, the African subgroup has neither the largest sample size nor the largest number of SNPs following quality control (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). Thus, to investigate the power of MAPIT-R and its sensitivity to these parameters, we conducted simulation studies under a wide range of genetic architectures. Here, we found that MAPIT-R both controls type 1 error accurately and also has the power to effectively detect pathway level marginal epistasis, even for polygenic traits where the contribution from individual SNPs to the broad-sense heritability of a trait can be quite low (\textcolor{red}{Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Greg-Simulations}}) \cite{Crawford2017a}. We also ran versions of MAPIT-R on the real data, but with permuted phenotypes, to ensure that the model was not identifying significant non-additive genetic relationships by chance (Supplementary Figures \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-perm1-QQPlots-AllPaths} and \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-10perms-pValHists}). These permutations allowed us to investigate MAPIT-R's false discovery rates, in which we observe values only as high as 1.5\% across our different database-phenotype-subgroup combinations at multiple significance thresholds (Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-AllPops-FDRs}).

\subsection*{Evidence of Epistasis within the Non-African Subgroups}

In our analyses of the British, Chinese, Caribbean, Indian, and Pakistani subgroups, we identify 80 pathways in total that have significant marginal epistatic interactions. Interestingly, many of these pathways overlap with the set of significant results from the African subgroup; though, there is notably less overlap in results between each of the individual non-African subgroups (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Heatplots-KEGG} and Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Heatplots-REACTOME}). For example, in the height analysis with KEGG annotations, 6-out-of-7 and 7-out-of-8 enriched pathways identified using the Caribbean and Chinese subgroups overlap with those detected while using the African subgroup, respectively. However, there is no overlap in results from our marginal epistasis scans at the pathway level between the Chinese and Caribbean subgroups.

The pathways commonly identified for individuals in both the African and Caribbean subgroups contain the genes related to multiple kinases (e.g., \textit{MAPK1}, \textit{ROCK1}, \textit{PRKCB}, \textit{PAK1}) and calcium channel proteins (e.g., \textit{CACNA1S}, \textit{CACNA1D}) (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPITR-TopPathway-Overlap} and \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPITR-TopPathway-GeneCounts-Overlap}) --- many of which are supported by associations validated in previous GWA applications \cite{Cousminer2013,Wood2014a}. In contrast, the pathways with significant marginal epistatic effects identified in both the African and Chinese subgroups are pathways related to the immune system and contain multiple HLA loci (e.g., \textit{HLA-DRA}, \textit{HLA-DRB1}, \textit{HLA-A}, \textit{HLA-B}) (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPITR-TopPathway-Overlap} and \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPITR-TopPathway-GeneCounts-Overlap}). These results are unsurprising since it is well known that the MHC region holds significant clinical relevance in complex traits \cite{Wan2010,Rose2012,Stahl2012,Crawford2018b}; however, more recent work has also suggested that Han Chinese may be particularly enriched for interactions involving HLA loci \cite{Deng2020}. 

\subsection*{Stronger Epistatic Signals underlie BMI than Height}

In our analyses with the African subgroup, we detected far more significantly enriched pathways for BMI than in height while using both the KEGG and REACTOME database annotation (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Barplots-KEGG} and Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Barplots-REACTOME}). While there is considerable correlation between the MAPIT-R $p$-values in height and BMI (Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ = 0.76 in KEGG and 0.72 in REACTOME, respectively), there are stronger marginal epistatic signals in BMI that remain significant after Bonferroni-correction (Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African}). These results align with pedigree-based heritability estimates for each trait, which have indicated narrow-sense heritability is around $h^2 =$ 0.8 in height and between $h^2 =$ 0.4 and $h^2 =$ 0.6 in BMI \cite{Elks2012,Visscher2012}. Taken together, these estimates suggest that non-additive effects may play a greater role in BMI than height, as we have observed here.

We detected one specific cluster of pathways in the KEGG database with notably divergent statistical evidence for marginal epistasis in height versus BMI (see Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African}). These four highlighted pathways are related to oncogenic activity and include: genes associated with small cell lung cancer ($p$-value $= 3.20\times 10^{-10}$), the ErbB signaling pathway ($p$-value $= 3.30\times 10^{-7}$), genes associated with non-small cell lung cancer ($p$-value $= 1.64\times 10^{-6}$), and T-cell receptor signaling ($p$-value $= 6.12\times 10^{-6}$). There are predominantly two sets of gene families that appear in all four of these annotated gene sets: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and the AKT serine/threonine-protein kinases (see Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-MAPITR-PhenoComps-African-GeneCounts}). One particular gene in this group, \textit{AKT2}, has been associated with multiple monogenic disorders of glucose metabolism, including severe insulin resistance and diabetes, and severe fasting hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemia \cite{George2004,Manning2017,Latva-Rasku2018}, representing a possible driver of this cluster. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of crosstalk between the PI3Ks has been shown to reduce adiposity and metabolic syndrome in both human beings and other model organisms \cite{Ortega-Molina2015,Grigsby2018,Justice2017,Huang2018,Couto2019}.

\subsection*{Testing Variability in MAPIT-R with British Replicate Subpopulations}

One important consideration of our results is that the diverse non-European human ancestries in the UK Biobank have smaller sample sizes than recent GWA studies in individuals of European ancestry. Given the large sample size of over $N =$ 470,000 individuals for the full white British cohort in the UK Biobank, we decided to test whether subsampled datasets from this group --- similar in size to the non-European ancestry cohorts --- would be large enough to yield power and gain insight into the genetic variation of height and BMI. Here, we sampled four additional, non-overlapping random subgroups of $N =$ 4,000 British individuals and tested whether MAPIT-R scans in those data were consistent with our results for the original British 4,000 subgroup. We also constructed larger non-overlapping British subsamples of $N =$ 10,000 individuals to investigate how our results might vary with sample size. In total we analyzed five non-overlapping sets of $N =$ 4,000 British individuals and five non-overlapping sets of $N =$ 10,000 British individuals.

When applying MAPIT-R to these data replicates, we find that our results are robustly similar to what was observed in the original British 4,000 subgroup. Overall, there is a limited number of pathways with significant marginal epistatic effects, regardless of the pathway annotation scheme being used (i.e., KEGG versus REACTOME). Moreover, there is also very limited overlap in the significant pathways that were detected between each of the subsampled replicates. These results are depicted and summarized in Supplementary Figures \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-BritReps-Barplots}-\ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-BritReps-10perms-pValHists-pt2}. As previously done with the individuals of non-European ancestry, we also checked that the null hypothesis of MAPIT-R remained well-calibrated on these subsampled British replicates by permuting the height and BMI measurements. Once again, we found that MAPIT-R continued to exhibit low empirical false discovery and type 1 error rates (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-BritReps-FDRs-pt1}). Altogether, the consistency of these analyses compared to the results with the full cohort over 470,000 individuals demonstrate that sample size does not appear to be a driving factor in the detection of pathway-level marginal epistasis.

\subsection*{Pairwise Gene Interactions among Pathways with Marginal Epistatic Effects}

To better understand the genomic regions that are driving pathway-level marginal epistatic effects, we first investigated genes (and gene families) that appeared to be particularly enriched amongst the significant pathways identified by MAPIT-R. To accomplish this, we conducted two types of hypergeometric tests for enrichment to detect genes that are overrepresented amongst the pathway annotations with low $p$-values (Supplementary Tables \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-TopPathways-AllPaths-AllPhenos}). In the first, we took the annotations from a given database (i.e., KEGG or REACTOME) and implemented a standard hypergeometric test where we compared the number of times a gene appears within the set of significant epistatic pathways versus the number of times that same gene appears across all pathways in the database. Indeed, this type of test may be confounded by the fact that larger pathways naturally have more SNPs and are therefore more likely to be involved in non-additive genetic interactions (see Supplementary Figures \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-pValsVsNumSNPs} and \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-pValsVsNumSNPs-perm1}). To mitigate this concern, we run a second hypergeometric enrichment test using only pathways containing 1000 SNPs or fewer. By focusing on smaller pathways, we have the additional advantage of further assessing the extent to which pathway size may confound our understanding of genes driving crosstalk between pathways. 

Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Hypergeometric-RestrictedComps-African-BMI} shows the hypergeometric $p$-values for all genes in significant interacting pathways. Here, we focus on results for BMI within the African subgroup using annotations from the REACTOME database and we specifically highlight the only genes that were significant under both types of hypergeometric enrichment tests (i.e., the genes that were robustly identified as drivers regardless of the number of SNPs included in the test). Notably, these gene families (\textit{PSMA}, \textit{PSMB}, \textit{PSMC}, \textit{PSMD}, \textit{PSME}, and \textit{PSMF}) are all from proteasome which is the catalytic half of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) --- a critical system for a variety of processes related to protein degradation within the cell \cite{Voges1999,Livneh2016,Collins2017}. The main proteasome isoform, 26S, is made up of two main components: (\textit{i}) the 20S core particle (CP) of four stacked rings (two outer structural rings encoded by \textit{PSMA} genes, and two inner catalytic rings encoded by \textit{PSMB} genes), and (\textit{ii}) the 19S regulatory particle (RP) which caps both ends of the CP (encoded by both genes within the \textit{PSMC} and \textit{PSMD} families). See Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Proteasome-Panels}(a) for an illustration of this structure. Since these gene families covered both a large number of genomic sites, as well as known biologically relevant functions to BMI, we used the proteasome as a test case to further refine the pathway-level signal identified by MAPIT-R.
 
To investigate whether components of the proteasome served as a driver of significant marginal epistatic effects, we conducted a ``leave-one-out'' analysis with each of the gene families in the proteasome. More specifically, we first reran MAPIT-R on BMI after leaving out SNPs annotated within genes belonging to the \textit{PSMA}, \textit{PSMB}, \textit{PSMC}, \textit{PSMD}, \textit{PSME}, and \textit{PSMF} families (one family at a time). Next, we then compared these new ``leave-one-out'' MAPIT-R $p$-values to each pathway's original $p$-value from running MAPIT-R on the full data. This enabled us to identify whether the removal of a particular gene family would lead to a notable loss of information about a pathway's epistatic interactions with the rest of the genome. 
 
Figure \ref{InterPath-Main-Figure-Proteasome-Panels}(b) shows the results from this analysis, where we see that the \textit{PSMA} and \textit{PSME} gene families exhibit biologically interpretable changes in $p$-value magnitudes across the multiple REACTOME pathways. For the \textit{PSMA} gene family, we observe effectively zero examples of where removing these genes leads to an increase in the MAPIT-R $p$-values. As previously mentioned, the \textit{PSMA} gene family functionally encodes the outer two rings of the core four rings in the main 20S core. These outer ``alpha'' rings are gates which control the entry of proteins into the core of the proteasome. Unlike the regulatory caps or the inner ``beta'' rings encoded by the \textit{PSMB} family (which contain the proteolytic active sites), the outer rings are less involved with the actual protein degradation. This lack of functional activity may explain the lack of increase in MAPIT-R $p$-values, or lack of information lost, when \textit{PSMA} genes are removed from analysis. 
 
For the \textit{PSME} gene family, on the other hand, we find some of the largest increases in MAPIT-R $p$-values across multiple REACTOME pathways. Contextually, members of the \textit{PSME} gene family encode an alternative regulatory particle, 11S PA28$\alpha\beta$, that also associates with the 20S core. \textcolor{red}{PA28$\alpha\beta$ is an Interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) inducible regulatory protein that operates in a ubiquitin-independent manner and increases production of a particular subset of proteasomes known as immunoproteasomes} \cite{Groettrup1996,de2011,Raule2014,Murata2018}. Immunoproteasomes are specialized isoforms that are expressed at higher levels in hematopoietic cells and are more directly associated with immunity-related processes such as MHC antigen presentation \cite{Ferrington2012,Basler2013,McCarthy2015}. \textcolor{red}{Additionally, recent work has connected \textit{PSME} genes to the regulation of NF-$\kappa$B signaling} \cite{Sun2016,Mitchell2019}. Altogether, these connections to immune activity may explain why removal of the \textit{PSME} gene family affects the marginal epistatic signal in pathways related to NF-$\kappa$B, B-cells, HIV, and apoptosis. Lastly, conducting these ``leave-one-out'' MAPIT-R analyses in the other remaining UK Biobank subgroups, we observe that removing the \textit{PSME} gene family also leads to some of the largest increases in MAPIT-R $p$-values in individuals of non-African ancestry as well (Supplementary Figures \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Prot-Heatplots-African}-\ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Prot-Heatplots-Pakistani}). The consistency of this result across all subgroups suggests that \textit{PSME} is a key contributor to proteasome epistatic interactions with other regions along the genome. 

%These alternative isoforms, which can contain either two 11S caps or one 11S and one 19S cap (i.e., a ``hybrid proteasome''), are part of a subset of proteasomes known as immunoproteasomes.
%Further, PA28$\alpha\beta$ itself is an Interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) inducible regulatory protein that operates in a ubiquitin-independent manner and
%Further, PA28$\alpha\beta$ also increases production of a specific subset of MHC-1 presenting antigens \cite{Groettrup1996,de2011,Raule2014,Murata2018}, and 

\section*{Discussion}\label{InterPath-Discussion}

Here, we present the first scans for marginal epistasis within multiple human ancestries across signaling pathways and annotated gene sets. We implement a new method, MAPIT-R, to test for evidence of non-additive genetic effects on the pathway-level and apply the framework to six different human ancestries sampled in the UK Biobank including African, British, Caribbean, Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani subgroups. Using two different pathway databases, we study continuous measurements of height and body mass index (BMI) and find a total 245 pathways that have significant epistatic interactions with their polygenic background. We find that the African subgroup produces the majority of these results, with over 65\% of our 245 significant pathways being identified within this subgroup. Additionally, we find that pathways related to immunity, cellular signaling, and metabolism have significant signals in our genome-wide marginal epistasis scans, and that BMI produces more significant marginal epistatic interactions at the pathway level than height. In testing for drivers of our MAPIT-R results, we find evidence that the proteasome may be enriched for marginal epistatic interactions and characterize how proteasome gene families contribute to non-additive genetic architecture of complex traits. 

The fact that we find such an abundance of epistatic signals in the African subgroup underscores that African populations, and non-European ancestries in general, are particularly useful for complex trait genetics \cite{Dumitrescu2011,Rotimi2017,Choudhury2018,Martin2018,Mogil2018,Bien2019,Kuchenbaecker2019,Wojcik2019,Zhong2019,Bentley2020}. Past research has shown that African ancestry genomes offer a more complete characterization of the the genetic architecture of skin pigmentation \cite{Martin2017b,Crawford2017b}, reveal the evolutionary histories of FOXP2 and other loci \cite{Atkinson2018,Sugden2018}, and are needed for more transferable polygenic risk scores \cite{Duncan2019,Marnetto2020}. While many studies have generated a call for more GWA studies to be conducted in individuals of non-European ancestry  \cite{Need2009,Popejoy2016,Gurdasani2019,Martin2019,Sirugo2019}, we believe this study reveals that our understanding of the role of epistasis in human complex trait architecture and broad-sense heritability will also expand with multiethnic analyses. Our results suggest that non-European ancestries, and African ancestries in particular, may be better suited for identifying signals of epistasis than European ancestries. 

Our analyses are not without limitations. First, we are limited due to the computational costs of epistasis detection. Although, testing for marginal epistasis reduces our testing burden from standard exhaustive epistasis scans, MAPIT-R framework does not scale well to the full sample sizes of modern human genomic biobanks \cite{Crawford2017a,Crawford2018a,Moore2019}. Specifically, MAPIT-R encounters burdensome scalability when analyzing tens of thousands of individuals. An important direction for future research is to detect epistatic interactions using GWA summary statistics. Moving away from the need to have individual-level genotype-phenotype data to GWA study summary statistics has proven useful in both speeding up algorithmic efficiency as well as increasing power in multiple other GWA contexts \cite{Shi2016,Johnson2018,Ray2018,Turchin2019,Urbut2019,Cheng2020}. Another noticeable limitation is that MAPIT-R cannot be used to directly identify the interaction pairs that drive individual non-additive associations with a given trait. In particular, after identifying a pathway is involved in epistasis, it is still unclear which particular region of the genome it interacts with. Thus, despite being able to identify specific pathways that are involved in epistasis, MAPIT-R is unable to directly identify detailed interaction pairs. Exploring marginal epistasis results \textit{a posteriori} in a two step procedure can be one way to overcome these issues. For example, linking MAPIT-R with a framework that explicitly follows up on marginal epistasis signals with locus-focused methods such as fine-mapping \cite{Kichaev2014,Chen2015,Benner2016} or co-localization \cite{Hormozdiari2016,Zhu2016,Wen2017,Giambartolomei2018,Wallace2020} could even further expand the power of the framework.

\caption{\textbf{Heatmaps depicting the overlap of MAPIT-R significant KEGG pathways for (a) standing height and (b) body mass index (BMI) across the different ancestry-specific subgroups in the UK Biobank}. Here, subgroups in the UK Biobank included individuals based on their self-identified ancestries: ``African'', ``British'', ``Caribbean'', ``Chinese'', ``Indian'', and ``Pakistani'', respectively. Genome-wide significance was determined by using Bonferroni-corrected $p$-value thresholds based on the number of pathways tested in each database-phenotype-subgroup combination (see Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). The diagonal shows the total number of genome-wide significant pathways per subgroup. We observe that significant pathways identified in non-African subgroups overlap more often with pathways from the African subgroup than they do with pathways from the other, remaining non-African subgroups. Results for both phenotypes in the REACTOME database can be seen in Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-Heatplots-REACTOME}.}

\caption{\textbf{Scatterplots comparing the MAPIT-R $\bm{p}$-values using (a) KEGG and (b) REACTOME pathways annotations in height and body mass index (BMI) within the African subgroup in the UK Biobank.} For each plot, the x-axis depicts the -$\log_{10}$ transformed MAPIT-R $p$-value for height, while the y-axis shows the same results for BMI. The red horizontal and vertical dashed lines are marked at the Bonferroni-corrected $p$-value thresholds for genome-wide significance in each pathway-phenotype combination (see Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-UKBPopStats}). Pathways in the top right quadrant have significant marginal epistatic effects in both traits; while, points in the bottom right and top left quadrants are pathways that are uniquely enriched in height or BMI, respectively. The four highlighted pathways in blue represent a cluster metabolic related signaling pathways and gene-sets that have been functionally connected to BMI in previous studies \cite{George2004,Manning2017,Latva-Rasku2018}. Across both databases, BMI results have lower MAPIT-R $p$-values than height results on average. For these comparisons in all the UK Biobank subgroups, see Supplementary Figure \ref{InterPath-Supp-Figure-MAPITR-PhenoComps-AllPops}.}

\caption{\textbf{Scatterplots comparing the $\bm{p}$-values from the hypergeometric enrichment analyses using only (a) KEGG and (b) REACTOME pathways annotations with at most 1000 SNPs within the African subgroup in the UK Biobank.} Here, the gene-based $p$-values using the size restricted pathways are shown on the y-axis, while the results from the original unrestricted version of the analysis are given on the x-axis. The blue dashed circle in the panel \textbf{(b)} highlights the proteasome gene family cluster. For lists containing each gene's original and size-restricted hypergeometric $p$-values, see Supplementary Table \ref{InterPath-Supp-Table-Hypergeometric-RestrictedComps-African-BMI}. Note that we only show results for BMI because few MAPIT-R significant pathways in the height analysis remained after imposing the size restriction.}

\caption{\textbf{Structure of the proteasome and results from applying a ``leave-one-out'' approach to MAPIT-R with proteasome gene families}. \textbf{(a)} Models of the different isoforms of the proteasome. The ``26S Proteasome'' is the main isoform, composed of the 20S core particle (CP) and capped on both ends by the 19S regulatory particle (RP), which is required for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The ``Hybrid Proteasome'' isoform is produced when the CP binds on one end with an RP and on the other end with the IFN-$\gamma$-inducible complex PA28$\alpha\beta$. The \textit{PSMA} and \textit{PSMB} gene families encode components of the CP, the \textit{PSMC} and \textit{PSMD} gene families encode components of the RP, and members of the \textit{PSME} gene family encode PA28$\alpha\beta$. Note that \textit{PSMF} represents a proteasome inhibitor and is not shown. The structures shown were adopted and modified from the Protein Data Bank (human 26S proteasome, \url{https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5GJR}; mouse PA28$\alpha\beta$, \url{https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5MX5}) \cite{Murata2018}. \textbf{(b)} The heatmap shows the change in original MAPIT-R -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value for different REACTOME pathways when each proteasome gene family is removed one at a time in a ``leave-one-out'' manner. The analyses were conducted in BMI for the African subgroup of the UK Biobank. The x-axis shows each proteasome gene family and the y-axis lists each REACTOME pathway. Each column has been scaled by the number of SNPs present in the given gene family and, as a result, the heatmap specifically shows the -$\log_{10}$ $p$-value change per SNP. \textbf{(c)} The table shows the number of SNPs present in each proteasome gene family (left), as well as the number of SNPs present in each REACTOME pathway (right).}

And we analyzed multiple human ancestries due to the ongoing imbalance of published GWA studies that solely focuses on European-ancestry individuals \citep{Need2009,Popejoy2016,Gurdasani2019,Martin2019,Sirugo2019}. Roughly 20\% of published GWA studies have been conducted in individuals of non-European ancestries \citep{Gurdasani2019,Martin2019,Sirugo2019}, and that is despite ongoing awareness of this problem over the last decade \citep{Need2009,Popejoy2016} and an increasing amount of work showing the importance of studying non-European populations \citep{Dumitrescu2011,Martin2017a,Martin2017b,Mogil2018,Bien2019,Duncan2019,Kuchenbaecker2019,Wojcik2019,Zhong2019,Marnetto2020,Mostafavi2020}.
